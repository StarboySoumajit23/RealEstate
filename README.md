## Tools Used

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS provided utility-first CSS classes, enabling rapid and consistent styling across the application. Its flexibility allowed for easy customization of the user interface to meet the project's design requirements.
Framer motion:The website uses Framer Motion, a powerful animation library for React, to create smooth and visually engaging animations such as component transitions, fade-ins, and interactive effects.
