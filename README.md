React TailwindCSS

This project is an Real Estate App developed using React and TailwindCSS. The application allows users to add items, specify quantities, input prices, apply tax rates, and include discounts. Users can generate invoices and download them as PDFs, which can then be printed. The project utilizes html-to-image to capture data from the modal and convert it from canvas to PDF using jsPDF.
